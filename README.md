# Comparing National Material Capabilites (US & China)
## About 
This is a data repository about the US and China's national material capabilities from 1861 to 2007. The six indicators of national material capabilites of a country in this dataset are iron and steel production, military expenditure, military personnel, urban population, total population, and energy consumption.

## Possible Usage
This dataset might be useful for people who want to compare the national material capabilities of the United States and China and observe how they changed every year from 1861 to 2007. 

## Acknowledgements
This subset data is created using *Jupyter Lab* through *Anaconda*. You can download [Anaconda](https://unc-libraries-data.github.io/Python/Setup.html) here.

The original dataset is from the [Correlates of War Project](https://correlatesofwar.org). This is a direct link to that dataset [NMC v4 data](https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/NMC_v4_0.csv).

## Data Visualization 
Here are three charts that demonstrate the comparison of military expenditure, military personnel, and total population between the US and China.

This chart below compares the military expenditure of US and China from 1861 to 2007. The military expenditure of China is constantly lower than the US's. However, both lines experience ups and downs. For example, the line of US's military expenditure has one small spike during the WWI and a much bigger spike during the WWII. After that, the US's military expenditure keeps an increasing trend until 1990s due to the Cold War. On the line of China's military expenditure, there is an obvious trough during the Reform and Opening-up Policy since the Chinese government was focusing on economic flourishment.

The second graph is showing the comparison between the number of US and China's military personnel. Except for the Civil War, the two World Wars, and the first half of the Cold War, China's military personnel is usually larger than the US's. This chart is also showing that in recent fourty years, both countries's military personnel is having a downward trend in general.

Nevertheless, this graph below shows that China's total population is constantly larger than the US's throughout 1861 to 2007.

Combining the three charts above, we can reach the following conclusionsï¼š
1. Although China usually has a bigger number of military personnel, US has a greater percentage of its total population as military personnel. 
2. From the first chart we can see that US always has more military expenditure than China, while China usually has more military personnel than the US, which propably is due to its much more massive total population. Therefore, the US's military power is more financially-based, whereas China's military power is more population-based.
